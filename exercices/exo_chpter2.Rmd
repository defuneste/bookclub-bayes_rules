**Disclaimer:** This is just an attempt to provide answers. They could be wrong!    

### Exercise 2.1

a) $P(B|A) > P(B)$

b) $P(B|) < p(A)$

c) $P(B|A) > P(B)$

d) $P(B|A) > P(B)$


### Exercice 2.2

a) $P(B|A)$

b) $P(A)$ 

c) $P(D)$

d) $P(D|C)$

e) $P(F \cap E) $

f) $P(F|E) $


### Exercice 2.3

Terms used:  
 - $P(V)$: probability of being a vampire and $P(V^c)$ not being a vampire  
 - $P(S)$: probability of sparkling and $P(S^c)$ not sparkling
 
 We first need to get the $P(V)$ (normalizing constant) which is the sum of sparkling while being a vampire plus the probability of sparkling without being a vampire: 
 
$$ P(S) = P(S|V) * P(V) + P(S|V^c) * (1 - P(V)) $$

```{r}
P_S = 0.7 * 0.05 + 0.03 * 0.95
P_S
```

Edward sparked so the probability of vampire existing is $\frac{prior * likelihood}{normalizing constant}$ 

```{r}
0.7 * 0.05/P_S
```
